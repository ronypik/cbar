# cbar
This R package focuses on tools for detecting anomaly on a time series, using
Bayesian contextual anomaly detection.

It has three main goals:

* Detect anomaly on time series

* Indentify the most important features needed for data analysis

* Provide automatic analysis that makes them easy to use from R

# TODO

* Report for each analysis e.g.) check_model
