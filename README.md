# cbar
This R package focuses on tools for detecting anomaly on a time series, using
Bayesian contextual anomaly detection.

It has three main goals:

* Detect anomaly on time series

* Indentify the most important features needed for data analysis

* Provide automatic analysis that makes them easy to use from R

# Terminology
* .data: data table to be used

* .scope: training period, testing period, and KPI names

* .setting: algorithm setting

* .plans: combination of .scope and .setting

* .prior: prior values for model and formula tables for i.v. and d.v.

* .result

# TODO
* Report for each analysis e.g.) check_model
